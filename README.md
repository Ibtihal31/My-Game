## Approach taken:
I took an iterative approach to building out the game. First I drew out some initial wireframes on (https://wireframe.cc/pro/pp/0640b5546321806 ), and then I focused on building core functionality. Last, add on CSS and style.

## Technologies used:
The game is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and DOM manipulation. The code uses Animation API (GSAP), event listeners and array methods.

# Installation:
My game is hosted at GitHub pages ( https://ibtihal31.github.io/My-Game/ ) .

## Lessons Learned:
- Practicing more of HTML , CSS , JS , DOM.  
- Learnd about somethig called (GSAP), which is a library that lets you create animations with JavaScript.
- Styling/CSS skills need some work and take a lot of time if you let it
- Pepole who build games are AWESOME :) 


## Features to add later: 
- More creative design
